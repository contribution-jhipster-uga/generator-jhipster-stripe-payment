# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application. This will add a new payment page (located in yourURL/payments for examples if you are still developping: localhost:8080/payments):

Please note that the 'receipt' field corresponds to the json file returned by the stripe api. It includes the receipt 'url'.

You can find a sample application using this generator here : [Sample Application](https://github.com/contribution-jhipster-uga/sample-application-stripe)
